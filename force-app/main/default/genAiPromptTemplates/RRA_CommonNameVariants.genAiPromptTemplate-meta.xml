        <content>You are analyzing the entity named `{!$Input:Name}`. Your goal is to generate a comprehensive list of plausible and commonly used name variants that may appear in public, business, or legal contexts.

Variant rules:

People

* Include common nicknames/diminutives and short forms for the detected language(s) (e.g., “michael” → “mike”, “mikey”; “elizabeth” → “liz”, “beth”; “alexander” → “alex”). Prefer only well-established nicknames.
* Include initialed forms that preserve the full surname (e.g., “m. smith”, “mj smith” if a middle/second given name/initial is present in the input or widely known).
* Include with/without middle names/initials exactly as present in input (do not invent unseen middle names).
* Preserve suffixes when present (e.g., “jr”, “sr”, “ii”, “iii”), and also include the no-suffix counterpart if both forms are commonly used in business contexts.
* Include hyphenation, spacing, and punctuation variants that are customary (e.g., “anne-marie” ↔ “annemarie”; “o’connor” ↔ “oconnor”).
* Include diacritic and diacritic-stripped versions (e.g., “josé garcía” and “jose garcia”).
* Include common transliterations/romanizations and name-order swaps when culturally applicable (e.g., “zhang wei” ↔ “wei zhang”), but avoid speculative forms.
* Include maiden/married/stage/pen/known-as names if they are widely used in public/business contexts for the same person.
* Exclude honorifics/titles (e.g., “dr”, “prof”), email handles, and bare given/surname alone unless the person is mononymous in business use.

Organizations

* Include the legal name exactly as given and variants differing only by punctuation/casing/spacing (“&amp;” ↔ “and”, hyphens, periods).
* Include legal suffix variants where interchangeable in records: “inc”/“inc.”, “corp”/“corporation”, “co”/“company”, “llc”, “ltd”/“limited”, “gmbh”, “ag”, “sa”, “spa”, etc., keeping regionally appropriate forms. Include with and without punctuation.
* Include acronyms/initialisms and the expanded form (e.g., “international business machines” ↔ “ibm”).
* Include dba/brand/aka/ formerly known as names if widely used in commerce.
* Include diacritic-stripped and transliterated forms when applicable.
* Optionally include article variants where customary (“the x company” ↔ “x company”).
* Exclude URLs, @handles, slogans, and product names unless they are documented DBA/AKA names of the entity.

General normalization

* Trim whitespace; collapse multiple spaces to one.
* Lowercase everything; keep only ASCII for the diacritic-stripped alternates while also retaining the original diacritic form when applicable.
* Do not fabricate unseen data (e.g., unknown middle names, speculative nicknames, or unsubstantiated aliases).
* If the input appears ambiguous (e.g., could be person or org), produce variants for the most likely interpretation but avoid far-fetched expansions.

Output requirements:

* Return only a valid JSON array of strings, UTF-8 encoded.
* Each string must be strictly lowercase.
* Do not include any envelope object, comments, labels, or markdown — array only.
* Deduplicate exact and near-duplicates (after trimming and normalizing whitespace).
* Sort with the normalized input first, then by likely business prevalence, then alphabetically.

Return the final result as a JSON array only.
